1. Minimise meetings, but encourage frequent communication
2. Have a daily rota with a different senior engineer dedicated to reviewing merge requests and pair programming.
3. Encourage all members of the team to create tickets as they think of improvements to your products/service so that there isn't a bottleneck reliant on one person.
4. Encourage becoming a generalist, and don't be afraid of spreading work relating to DevOps/Data Analysis/Data Engineering/SecOps/Solutions Architecture amongst different engineers.
5. Embrace the DevOps mindset, and monitor and test everything; with alerts set up to monitor unexpected behaviour.
