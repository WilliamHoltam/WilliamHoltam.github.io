Hi! My name is William Holtam and I have been working in the data and cloud space in London (UK) as a Software Engineer since 2018 when I graduated with a Physics BSc (Hons) from the University of Surrey, UK. In that time I have worn many hats including Data Scientist, Data Engineer, DevOps Engineer, MI Tech Lead, Lead Data Engineer, and Lead Data Analyst which has given me a solid foundation, with a bredth of experience upon which I want to build and specialise. One way to do that is to write about my opinions, and what I've learned; so welcome!
