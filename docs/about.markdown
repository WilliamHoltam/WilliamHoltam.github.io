Hi! My name is Will and I have been working in the data and cloud space in London (UK) as a Software Engineer since 2018 when I graduated with a Physics BSc (Hons) from the University of Surrey, UK. In that time I have worn many hats which has given me a solid foundation, with a bredth of experience upon which I want to build and specialise. One way to do that is to write about my opinions, and what I've learned; so welcome!
